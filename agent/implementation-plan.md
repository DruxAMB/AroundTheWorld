Implementation Steps:
1. Create Spend Permission Component

Build UI component allowing users to grant spending permissions to the reward distribution wallet
Set spending limits and duration for automated reward payouts
Integration with existing OnchainKit wallet components
2. Set up CDP Server Wallet

Create server-side wallet using CDP SDK for automated transactions
Configure wallet to receive spend permissions from users
Store wallet credentials securely in environment variables
3. Build Reward Distribution API

Create /api/rewards/distribute endpoint using CDP SDK
Integrate with existing leaderboard data from Redis
Automatically calculate and send rewards to top players
4. AI Agent Logic

Trigger automatic reward distribution on leaderboard resets
Smart logic to determine reward amounts based on performance
Integration with existing weekly reset functionality
5. Admin Interface Integration

Add spend permission management to existing /update admin panel
Monitor active permissions and reward distribution history
Manual override capabilities for reward distributions
6. Connect to Existing Systems

Use current RewardDistributionService for payout calculations
Leverage existing leaderboard reset triggers
Integrate with Farcaster notifications for reward announcements
This builds directly on your existing infrastructure - the leaderboard system, reward calculations, and admin panel. The CDP wallet becomes the "AI agent" that automatically distributes rewards when triggered by game events.
