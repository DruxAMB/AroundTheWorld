## ‚ú® Why Onchain?

Bringing a classic match-3 game onchain allows us to move beyond traditional gaming and offer unique benefits to our players:

- **True Ownership**: Your wallet is your passport. Player profiles, progress, and achievements are tied to your onchain identity, not a disposable email login. Your journey is verifiably yours.
- **Transparent Competition**: Leaderboards are powered by real, on-chain data and persistent storage, ensuring a fair and transparent competitive environment for all players.
- **Composable Future**: By building on Base, we open the door to future integrations like NFT-based rewards, in-game economies, and collaborations with other onchain projects.
- **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with a wallet can play, compete, and own their progress, breaking down barriers and creating a truly global player base.

## üéÆ Game Features

- **Five Themed Worlds**: Journey through Africa, India, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, each with unique visuals and authentic regional music.
- **Classic Match-3 Fun**: Intuitive swap-and-match gameplay that's easy to learn but hard to master.
- **Dynamic Mechanics**: Create special items, trigger explosive combos, and watch cascading chain reactions light up the board.
- **Competitive Leaderboards**: Climb the ranks on weekly, monthly, and all-time leaderboards to prove your skills.
- **Persistent & Cross-Device**: Connect your wallet and your progress is automatically saved and synced across all your devices.

## üîÆ Roadmap: The Onchain Summer & Beyond

We're just getting started. Our vision is to deepen the onchain experience throughout the Onchain Summer event. Our immediate roadmap includes:

1.  **Onchain Power-ups**: Implement a system for players to purchase extra moves or boosts using ETH, directly generating onchain activity.
2.  **NFT Achievements**: Award players with unique, non-transferable NFTs for completing levels or achieving high ranks.
3.  **Community Treasury**: A portion of revenue from onchain purchases will fund a community-governed treasury for future development and prizes.
